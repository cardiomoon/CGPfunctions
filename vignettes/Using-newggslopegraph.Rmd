This function is designed to automate the process of producing a [Tufte style slopegraph](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk) using `ggplot2`. 

I've been aware of slopegraphs and bumpcharts for quite some time, and I certainly am aware of [Tufte's work](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/). As an amateur military historian I've always loved, for example, [his poster](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters) depicting Napoleon's Russian Campaign. So when I saw the article from [Murtaza Haider](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/murtaza-haider/) titled *"Edward Tufteâ€™s Slopegraphs and political fortunes in Ontario"* I just had to take a shot at writing a function.

To make it a little easier to get started with the function I have taken the libefty of providing the cancer data in a format where it is immediately useable.  Please see `?newcancer`.

## Installation and setup

Long term I'll try and ensure the version on `CRAN` is well maintained but for now you're better served by grabbing the current version from GITHUB.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
# Install from CRAN
# install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
library(CGPfunctions)
```

## Simple examples

If you're unfamiliar with slopegraphs or just want to see what the display is all about the dataset I've provided can get you started in one line

```{r ggslope1, fig.height=10, fig.width=7}
newggslopegraph(newcancer,Year,Survival,Type)
```

Optionally you can provide important label information through `Title`, `Subtitle`, and `Caption` arguments.  You can suppress them all together by setting them `= NULL` but since I think they are very important the default is to gently remind you, that you have not tpovidecd any information.  Let's provide a title and sub-title but skip the caption.

```{r ggslope2, , fig.height=10, fig.width=7}
newggslopegraph(dataframe = newcancer,
                Times = Year,
                Measurement = Survival,
                Grouping = Type,
                Title = "Estimates of Percent Survival Rates",
                SubTitle = "Based on: Edward Tufte, Beautiful Evidence, 174, 176.",
                Caption = NULL
                )
```

## How it all works

It's all well and good to get the little demo to work, but it might be useful for you to understand how to extend it out to data you're interested in.

You'll need a dataframe with at least three columns.  The function will do some basic error checking and complain if you don't hit the essentials.

1.  `Times` is the column in the dataframe that corresponds to the x axis of the plot and is normally a set of moments in time expressed as either characters, factors or ordered factors (in our case `newcancer$Year`.  If it is truly time series data (esepcially with a lot of dates you're much better off using an R function purpose built for that). In `newcancer` it's an ordered factor, mainly because if we fed the information in as character the sort order would be `Year 10, Year 15, Year 20, Year 5` which is very suboptimal. A command like `newcancer$Year <- factor(newcancer$Year,levels = c("Year.5", "Year.10", "Year.15", "Year.20"), labels = c("5 Year","10 Year","15 Year","20 Year"), ordered = TRUE)` would be the way to force things they way you want them.
2.  `Measurement` is the column that has the actual numbers you want to display along the y axis. Frequently that's a percentage but it could just as easily be any number.  Watch out for scaling issues here you'll want to ensure that its not disparate. In our case `newcancer$Survival` is the percentage of patients surviving at that point in time, so the maximum scale is 0 to 100.
3.  `Grouping` is what controls how many individual lines are portrayed. Every attempt is made to color them and label them in ways that lead to clarity but eventually you can have too many. In our example case the column is `newcancer$Type` for the type of cancer or location.

The documentation examples use the `mtcars` built-in dataset.  It's handy, convenient, and it's installed by default. To actually show the function in action, however, I'm going to use a different dataset.  Something that should allow you to better see the value of making plots of the crosstabs rather than simple tables.  It also has the happy property of being much much larger than `mtcars` so we can see if there are lags in performance due to the number of rows.

Rather than provide my own or make anyone work too hard I selected that `happy` dataset that comes bundled with several `R` packages including `productplots` and `GGally`.   From the description:

> The data is a small sample of variables related to happiness from the general social survey (GSS). The GSS is a yearly cross-sectional survey of Americans, run from 1976. We combine data for 25 years to yield 51,020 observations, and of the over 5,000 variables, we select nine related to happiness. 


We'll be focusing on the non numeric variables.  I certainly can't claim to do a detailed analysis here but at least the questions will be fun I hope...

```{r ggslope2}

```

I hope you've found this useful.  I am always open to comments, corrections and suggestions.
