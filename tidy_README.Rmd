## Overview

A package that includes functions that I find useful for teaching statistics as well as actually practicing the art.  They typically are not "new" methods but rather wrappers around either base R or other packages and concepts I'm trying to master.  Currently contains:

- `Plot2WayANOVA` which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and plots the results using `ggplot2`
- `neweta` which is a helper function that appends the results of a Type II eta squared calculation onto a classic ANOVA table
- `Mode` which finds the modal value in a vector of data
- `SeeDist` which wraps around ggplot2 to provide visualizations of univariate data.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
```

## Usage

`library(CGPfunctions)` will load the package which contains 4 functions: 

`SeeDist` will give you some plots of the distribution of a variable using `ggplot2`
```{r SeeDist}
library(CGPfunctions)
SeeDist(mtcars$hp,whatvar="Horsepower",whatplots="d")
```

`Mode` is a helper function that simply returns one or more modal values
```{r Mode}
Mode(mtcars$hp)
```

`neweta` is a helper function which returns a tibble containing AOV output similar to summary(aov(MyAOV)) but with eta squared computed and appended as an additional column
```{r neweta}
MyAOV <- aov(mpg~am*cyl, mtcars)
neweta(MyAOV)
```




## Credits

Many thanks to Dani Navarro and the book &gt; ([Learning Statistics with R](http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html)) whose etaSquared function was the genesis of `neweta`.
