## Overview

A package that includes functions that I find useful for teaching statistics as well as actually practicing the art.  They typically are not "new" methods but rather wrappers around either base R or other packages and concepts I'm trying to master.  Currently contains:

- `Plot2WayANOVA` which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and plots the results using `ggplot2`
- `neweta` which is a helper function that appends the results of a Type II eta squared calculation onto a classic ANOVA table
- `Mode` which finds the modal value in a vector of data
- `SeeDist` which wraps around ggplot2 to provide visualizations of univariate data.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
```

## Usage

`library(CGPfunctions)` will load the package which contains: 


You can see conflicts created later with `tidyverse_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
# tidyverse_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all tidyverse packages are up-to-date with `tidyverse_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
# tidyverse_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```

Many thanks to Dani Navarro and the book &gt; ([Learning Statistics with R](http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html)) whose etaSquared function was the genesis of `neweta`.
